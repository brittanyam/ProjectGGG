# ProjectGGG
Hi guys this is a project created by me, Brittany Wood.
I wanted to see how I could make something cool using machine learning and books
I decided that I wanted to make a machine learning program that used all of gutenbergs catalog to understand books and recommend books based on excerpts of books that people may like.
I originally wanted to make it so that it did a type of analysis of the excerpts but I'm not sure where to start with that.
I plan on using the gutenberg pypi, pybrain, anaconda, nltk etc. etc.
